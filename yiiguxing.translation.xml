      <item value="FlatButton' is deprecated and shouldn't be used. Use TextButton instead. See the migration guide in flutter.devgomaterial-button-migration-guide). This feature was deprecated after v1.25.0-8.1.pre.. Try replacing the use of the deprecated member with the replacement. Open documentation" />
      <item value="Missing concrete implementation of 'StatelessWidget.build'. Try implementing the missing method, or make the class abstract. Open documentation" />
      <item value="Widget" />
      <item value="Column is also a layout widget. It takes a list of children and arranges them vertically. By default, it sizes itself to fit its children horizontally, and tries to be as tall as its parent. Invoke &quot;debug painting&quot; (press &quot;p&quot; in the console, choose the &quot;Toggle Debug Paint&quot; action from the Flutter Inspector in Android Studio, or the &quot;Toggle Debug Paint&quot; command in Visual Studio Code) to see the wireframe for each widget. Column has various properties to control how it sizes itself and how it positions its children. Here we use mainAxisAlignment to center the children vertically; the main axis here is the vertical axis because Columns are vertical (the cross axis would be horizontal)." />
      <item value="Center is a layout widget. It takes a single child and positions it in the middle of the parent." />
      <item value="Here we take the value from the MyHomePage object that was created by the App.build method, and use it to set our appbar title." />
      <item value="This method is rerun every time setState is called, for instance as done by the _incrementCounter method above. The Flutter framework has been optimized to make rerunning build methods fast, so that you can just rebuild anything that needs updating rather than having to individually change instances of widgets." />
      <item value="&lt;!-- Specifies an Android theme to apply to this Activity as soon as the Android process has started. This theme is visible to the user while the Flutter UI initializes. After that, this theme continues to determine the Window background behind the Flutter UI. --&gt;" />
      <item value="To take advantage of the latest features, improvements, and security fixes, we strongly recommend that you update the Android Gradle plugin from the current version 4.1.0 to version 4.1.2 and Gradle to version 6.5. Release notes" />

      <item value="&lt;!-- Displays an Android View that continues showing the launch screen Drawable until Flutter paints its first frame, then this splash screen fades out. A splash screen is useful to avoid any visual gap between the end of Android's launch screen and the painting of Flutter's first frame. --&gt;" />

      <item value="&lt;!-- Theme applied to the Android Window as soon as the process has started. This theme determines the color of the Android Window while your Flutter UI initializes, as well as behind your Flutter UI while its running. This Theme is only used starting with V2 of Flutter's Android embedding. --&gt;" />

      <item value="This widget is the home page of your application. It is stateful, meaning that it has a State object (defined below) that contains fields that affect how it looks. This class is the configuration for the state. It holds the values (in this case the title) provided by the parent (in this case the App widget) and used by the build method of the State. Fields in a Widget subclass are always marked &quot;final&quot;." />

      <item value="Support for developing Flutter applications. Flutter gives developers an easy and productive way to build and deploy cross-platform, high-performance mobile apps for both Android and iOS. Installing this plugin will also install the Dart plugin. For some tools, this plugin uses Chromium through JxBrowser to display content from the web. JxBrowser complies with LGPL and offers an option to replace Chromium with another component. To do this: Find the JxBrowser files stored in the plugins directory, under flutter-intellijjxbrowser. Use the instructions and build script from JxBrowser to relink it with modified components." />
