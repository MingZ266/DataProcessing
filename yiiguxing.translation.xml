A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43 followed by an optional build number separated by a +. Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively. In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

      <item value="Column is also a layout widget. It takes a list of children and arranges them vertically. By default, it sizes itself to fit its children horizontally, and tries to be as tall as its parent. Invoke &quot;debug painting&quot; (press &quot;p&quot; in the console, choose the &quot;Toggle Debug Paint&quot; action from the Flutter Inspector in Android Studio, or the &quot;Toggle Debug Paint&quot; command in Visual Studio Code) to see the wireframe for each widget. Column has various properties to control how it sizes itself and how it positions its children. Here we use mainAxisAlignment to center the children vertically; the main axis here is the vertical axis because Columns are vertical (the cross axis would be horizontal)." />

      <item value="This method is rerun every time setState is called, for instance as done by the _incrementCounter method above. The Flutter framework has been optimized to make rerunning build methods fast, so that you can just rebuild anything that needs updating rather than having to individually change instances of widgets." />

Flutter gives developers an easy and productive way to build and deploy cross-platform, high-performance mobile apps for both Android and iOS. Installing this plugin will also install the Dart plugin. For some tools, this plugin uses Chromium through JxBrowser to display content from the web. JxBrowser complies with LGPL and offers an option to replace Chromium with another component. To do this: Find the JxBrowser files stored in the plugins directory, under flutter-intellijjxbrowser. Use the instructions and build script from JxBrowser to relink it with modified components." />
